This program will take user inputs (Names) and store them into a binary search tree. There is not limit to how many names the user wants in this program. And once the user is done, the program will print out all the names in pre-order, in-order, and post-order. For extra credit, I made the program iterative instead of recursive making me incorporate stacks into the program. Also the user has full control of the data in the tree instead of a pre-set number of names ordered. My partners were Ben and Kennedi.
